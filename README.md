This respository is about Salary calculator in Java programming language. This application has a function that calculates an employee's salary, given how many hours 
that are worked per week and how much the person makes per hour. 

A user can enter how many hours the employee works per week, how much the person makes per hour also for the vacation days an employee might take. To account for the 
vacation days, I've created a variable called "Unpaid Time", and set it to the value of amount per hour times eight. This accounts for how much the employee should be 
paid less per year, based on one vacation day, however since I have a vacation days variable, I can multiply this by vacation days to see how much less, 
the employee should be paid per year. 
 
The formula of this salary calculator: ((hoursPerWeek * amountPerHour) *52) - (vacationDays * amountPerHour * 8)

**What I learnt while making this application above:** In this programme, I learnt how to make many functions 
such as calling functions and various built-in functions. I learnt how to create a function that calculates 
an employee's salary, given how many hours that are worked per week and how much the person makes per hour. 

**How might I improve:** Adding more comments around the code to show my understanding. Furthermore, I would more code that permit user to enter tax rate and calculate 
net salary.
